-.test allows you to test a string against regular expression and return a boolen (true or false)

-.exec allows essentialy the same thing except it dosent return a boolen it returns a array with all the matching groups such as the literal string, the index of where the string was found,and the entire string it was attached to.

-Simple expression matches text with the entire test string 


-The most two important and common flags are g- global which stops after the first return 
and i- which makes the search case insensitive
